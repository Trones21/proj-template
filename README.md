# Project Templates

A collection of project templates for different languages and frameworks.  
Functionality and structure will vary depending on the template â€” see the `README.md` inside each template folder (e.g., `go/`, `python-django/`) for specific details.

All templates are built from scratch using patterns that have worked well for me in real-world projects.  
Feel free to use, adapt, and extend them â€” enjoy! ðŸš€
