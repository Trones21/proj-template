# Django Project Generator

A minimal yet powerful project generator for Django backends.  
It scaffolds a complete Django backend, request flow clients for API testing, and basic deployment scripts ‚Äî so you can start building immediately.

No unnecessary bloat. No weird dependencies. Just a clean foundation.

---

## Usage

1. Make sure the generator script (`create_project.sh`) is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x create_project.sh
   ```

2. Run the generator:

   ```bash
   ./create_project.sh -n <your_project_name>
   ```

3. After running, your project will be created under:
   ```
   ~/Documents/git_repos/<your_project_name>/
   ```
   and environment setup files will be placed under:
   ```
   ~/env_setup/<your_project_name>/
   ```

## To-Do After Generation

### Backend

Open Your Project Folder:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/git_repos/<your_project_name>
# or whatever you passed to the -d flag
```

‚úÖ Set up your environment variables:

```bash
nano ~/env_setup/<your_project_name>/local_backend.sh
# When ready to deploy, update prod_backend.sh
```

‚úÖ Apply environment variables

```bash
source ~/env_setup/<your_project_name>/local_backend.sh
```

‚úÖ Install Python dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Tip: If requirements.txt doesnt exist, you can always use `pipreqs`: `pip install pipreqs` then `pipreqs ./`(when pwd is root of project)**

### Local DB Setup

Install request flow dependencies (since the create_db script lives there):

```bash
cd ../request_flows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[Install Postgres (if not already installed)](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/)

‚úÖ Create the database

```bash
python ~/path-to-project/request_flows/create_db.py
```

‚úÖ Make and apply Django migrations:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

‚úÖ Create a Django superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

‚úÖ Start developing! üöÄ

You can run a simple test by loading the fixtures and running the login_test in the test runner.
`<Pk_ToDo - Add Video without the example_app items in the list (just the test login) (will create after cleaning noCRUD implementation from examples)>`

### Frontend

Set up the frontend:

- Use [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/start/installation) or your preferred frontend stack.

### Docker

#### TL;DL ‚Äî Docker in 30 Seconds

This isnt a tutorial on docker, but i think it is important to clarify some basics about how docker works:

_(See `DOCKER_REF.md` for deeper explanations.)_

---

1. **Build an image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -f <Dockerfile> -t <image-name>:<tag> <build-context>
   ```

2. **Run a container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d -p <machine-port>:<container-port> --name <container-name> <image-name>:<tag>
   ```

   _or run multiple containers:_

   ```bash
   docker compose -f ./compose_local.yaml up -d
   ```

3. **Containers talk over Docker‚Äôs internal network** by **service name**.

4. **Jump into a container:**

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <container-name> /bin/bash
   ```

---

# My Process (As Decoupled as possible)

- **Verify** frontend and backend images separately first (`verify_docker_builds.sh`).
  - `docker compose` **NEVER** has build steps - use commands / shell scripts for more control
- **Deploy** both images to the server (`deploy.sh`).

#### Verify Docker Builds

Open `verify_docker_builds.sh`.

Start simple: comment out either the backend or frontend and get one image building cleanly.  
Once both are building, verify communication:

```txt
Frontend <-> Backend <-> DB (local Postgres, not containerized)
```

#### Deployment

Once that‚Äôs working, move on to `deploy.sh`.

By this point, you should have a solid handle on where config issues may arise ‚Äî and be comfortable with key Docker workflows:

- Multi-step Docker builds
- Jumping into containers with `docker exec` (feels just like SSH ‚Äî it's just a little isolated Linux box)
- Troubleshooting cross-container communication
- Making files available to the container **after** build (e.g., bind mounts vs baking files in)

Also check out:

- `DOCKER_REF.md` ‚Äî for deeper Docker context
- The "Deployment Summary" section below ‚Äî for step-by-step remote deployment guidance (basically the steps that deploy.sh takes if you were to do them manually)

## Basic Structure

I keep the same basic structure for all my applications. Note that Quasar is not currently setup by this script

```txt
+---------------------+
|  Reverse Proxy      | (Container 1: Traefik)
|   - / -> Frontend   |
|   - /api -> Backend |
+---------------------+
        |           |
+----------------+   +----------------+
| Frontend        |   | Backend        |
| Quasar Files    |   | Django         |
| Running on Nginx|   |                |
+----------------+   +----------------+

```

### Deployment Summary

Current process is **build the images locally** (with prod settings) and copy (scp) to server

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Remember to backup RDS and migrate(update db schema)!! Prod DB operations are not handled by `deploy.sh`

Everything below is automated in `deploy.sh`, but here‚Äôs the general flow.  
For deeper container-specific details, see the frontend and backend READMEs.

#### On Dev Machine

```bash
docker-compose build

docker save -o frontend.tar frontend:latest
docker save -o backend.tar backend:latest

scp frontend.tar backend.tar user@server:/deploypath/
scp docker-compose.yml user@server:/deploypath/
```

#### On Server

```bash
docker load < /deploypath/frontend.tar
docker load < /deploypath/backend.tar
# Note: Ensure docker-compose.yml has the correct reference to the containers

#check to see the images
docker images

# Start the containers!
docker-compose up -d #detached (run in background, return control to terminal)
```

#### All about the uris...

Traefik as the Reverse Proxy:

1. Traefik handles the routing and allows you to create clean, logical paths (e.g., /api for backend routes).
   It decouples your frontend from needing to know the backend's exact service URLs.
   Backend Routes Stay Clean:

2. The backend (Go app) can maintain simple routes like /someEndpoint without being aware of the reverse proxy.

- This avoids hardcoding /api into your backend code, which might be environment-specific.

3. Frontend Knows the Mapped Path:

- The frontend only needs to call /api/someEndpoint because it‚Äôs interacting with Traefik‚Äôs routes.

4. Flexibility for Future Changes:

- If I ever need to change the path mapping (e.g., /api to /backend), you only update Traefik‚Äôs config without touching the frontend or backend code.

## Misc Reminders:

Update `deploy.sh`:

- Set your SSH login credentials for deployment.
