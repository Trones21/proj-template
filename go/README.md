# Go Project Generator

A minimal yet powerful project generator for Go backends.  
It scaffolds a complete backend, request flow clients for API testing, and basic deployment scripts â€” so you can start building immediately.

No unnecessary bloat. No weird dependencies. Just a clean foundation.

---

## Usage

1. Make sure the generator script (`create_project.sh`) is executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x create_project.sh
   ```

2. Run the generator:

   ```bash
   ./create_project.sh -n <your_project_name>
   ```

3. After running, your project will be created under:
   ```
   ~/Documents/git_repos/<your_project_name>/
   ```
   and environment setup files will be placed under:
   ```
   ~/env_setup/<your_project_name>/
   ```

## What's Included

### Project Structure

- **backend/** â€” Go backend starter with:

  - `cmd/app/` â€” Main application entry (`main.go`)
  - `internal/` â€” Modularized structure:
    - `handlers/` â€” Route handlers for endpoints (e.g., user onboarding)
    - `helpers/` â€” Common helper utilities
    - `middleware/` â€” CORS, logging, recovery, and auth middleware
    - `services/brevo/` â€” Email integration (Brevo / Sendinblue)
    - `repositories/` â€” Placeholder for database operations
  - `db/`
    - SQLC config (`sqlc.yaml`)
    - Database migrations (`migrations/`)
    - Queries (`queries/`)
    - Fixtures for loading necessary static data
    - DB utility scripts (reset, backup, recreate)
  - `configs/` â€” App configuration files
  - Go module files (`go.mod`, `go.sum`), Dockerfile, and supporting files

- **request_flows/** â€” Lightweight Go client for:

  - Simulating API requests
  - Performing smoke tests and validation flows
  - Utilities for authentication and JSON handling
  - A basic example flow included

- **\_top_level_docs/** â€” Docs starter:

  - `USEFUL.md` â€” General project tips and links
  - Blank `README.md` for your project-specific notes

- **\_images/** â€” Placeholder for architecture diagrams or visual assets

- **frontend/** â€” Placeholder (you'll manually create a frontend app, e.g., Quasar)

### Deployment and Environment Management

- Local build and deploy scripts:
  - `build_and_deploy_local.sh`
  - `compose_local.yaml`
- Production deploy scripts:
  - `deploy.sh`
  - `compose_deploy.yaml`
- Environment setup:
  - `~/env_setup/<your_project_name>/local_backend.sh`
  - `~/env_setup/<your_project_name>/prod_backend.sh`

### Other Utilities

- `sandbox.sh` â€” Quick testing script
- `backup_image.sh` â€” Docker image backup
- `docker_cleanup.sh` and `docker_cleanup_keep_opi.sh` â€” Cleanup helpers
- `.dockerignore`, `.gitignore`, and configuration examples for Traefik and Prometheus (under `no-modification-before-copy/`)

---

## To-Do After Generation

âœ… Navigate to your project folder:

```bash
cd ~/Documents/git_repos/<your_project_name>
```

âœ… Set up your environment variables:

```bash
cd ~/env_setup/<your_project_name>
# Edit local_backend.sh and prod_backend.sh as needed
```

## Local Create DB

Install request flow dependencies (since the create_db script lives there):

```bash
cd ../request_flows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

[Install Postgres (if not already installed)](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/)

âœ… Create the database

```bash
python ~/path-to-project/request_flows/create_db.py
```

[Apply a standard set of privileges for app_user](https://thomasrones.com/technical/other/postgresql/apply-priv)

---

âœ… Update `deploy.sh`:

- Set your SSH login credentials for deployment.

âœ… (Optional) Set up the frontend:

- Use [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/start/installation) or your preferred frontend stack.

âœ… Install Go dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
go mod tidy
```

âœ… Start developing! ðŸš€

## Basic Structure

I keep the same basic structure for all my applications. Note that Quasar is not currently setup by this script

```txt
+---------------------+
|  Reverse Proxy      | (Container 1: Traefik)
|   - / -> Frontend   |
|   - /api -> Backend |
+---------------------+
        |           |
+----------------+   +----------------+
| Frontend        |   | Backend        |
| Quasar Files    |   | Django      |
| Running on Nginx|   |                |
+----------------+   +----------------+

```

### Deployment

Current process is build the containers locally (with prod settings) and copy to server

- Remember to backup RDS and migrate(update db schema)!! This is integrated into deployment

This is all in deploy.sh/build_and_deploy.sh.. but here is the general process. Look to the frontend and backend readmes for deep guidance on their containers.

#### On Dev Machine

```bash
docker-compose build

docker save -o frontend.tar frontend:latest
docker save -o backend.tar backend:latest

scp frontend.tar backend.tar user@server:/deploypath/
scp docker-compose.yml user@server:/deploypath/
```

#### On Server

```bash
docker load < /deploypath/frontend.tar
docker load < /deploypath/backend.tar
# Note: Ensure docker-compose.yml has the correct reference to the containers

#check to see the images
docker images

# Start the containers!
docker-compose up -d #detached (run in background, return control to terminal)
```

#### All about the uris...

Traefik as the Reverse Proxy:

1. Traefik handles the routing and allows you to create clean, logical paths (e.g., /api for backend routes).
   It decouples your frontend from needing to know the backend's exact service URLs.
   Backend Routes Stay Clean:

2. The backend (Go app) can maintain simple routes like /someEndpoint without being aware of the reverse proxy.

- This avoids hardcoding /api into your backend code, which might be environment-specific.

3. Frontend Knows the Mapped Path:

- The frontend only needs to call /api/someEndpoint because itâ€™s interacting with Traefikâ€™s routes.

4. Flexibility for Future Changes:

- If I ever need to change the path mapping (e.g., /api to /backend), you only update Traefikâ€™s config without touching the frontend or backend code.
